## Installation

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/locomotive-agency/mcp-anywhere.git
cd mcp-anywhere

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or install with pip
pip install -e .

# Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with required values:
# SECRET_KEY=<secure-random-key>
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Start server
mcp-anywhere serve http
# Or: python -m mcp_anywhere serve http
# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

### Production Deployment (Fly.io)

```bash
# Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Deploy application
cd mcp-anywhere
fly launch
fly secrets set SECRET_KEY=<secure-random-key>
fly secrets set JWT_SECRET_KEY=<jwt-secret-key>
fly secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
fly deploy

# Application available at https://your-app.fly.dev
```

### Docker

Deploying the application as a docker container using docker compose.

```bash
# Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with required values:
# SECRET_KEY=<secure-random-key>
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Build and Deploy the application

```bash
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.native.yml up -d --build
```

View logs to see status

```bash
$ docker logs mcp-anywhere-app
```

Navigate to `http://<DOCKER-HOST>:8000/` to use the application

## Usage

### Adding Tools from GitHub

Use the web interface to add MCP server repositories:
- Official MCP servers: `https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers`
- Python interpreter: `https://github.com/yzfly/mcp-python-interpreter`
- Any compatible MCP repository

The system uses Claude AI to automatically analyze and configure repositories.

### Configuration

- **API Keys**: Centralized credential storage
- **Secret Files**: Secure upload and management of credential files (JSON, PEM, certificates)
- **Tool Management**: Enable or disable specific tools
- **Container Settings**: Automatic Docker containerization

### Secret File Management

MCP Anywhere supports secure upload and management of credential files for MCP servers:

**Supported File Types:**
- JSON credential files (.json)
- PEM certificates and keys (.pem, .key, .crt, .cert)
- PKCS12/PFX certificates (.p12, .pfx)
- Java KeyStores (.jks, .keystore)
- Configuration files (.yaml, .yml, .xml, .txt)

**Features:**
- Files are encrypted at rest using AES-128 (Fernet)
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Files are mounted as read-only volumes in containers
- Environment variables automatically set with file paths
- Automatic cleanup when servers are deleted

**Usage via Web Interface:**
1. Navigate to the server detail page
2. Use the "Upload Secret File" form
3. Specify an environment variable name (e.g., `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`)
4. Upload the credential file
5. The file will be automatically mounted when the container starts

**Security Considerations:**
- Files are stored encrypted in `DATA_DIR/secrets/<server_id>/`
- Each server has isolated secret storage
- Files are only decrypted when mounting to containers
- Container access is read-only

### Client Integration

**Claude Desktop Configuration:**

First run `which uv`, which will print out a path to the uv binary. For example on macOS:

```
/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uv
```

You can then use that in the start command. Change the `--directory` path to your MCP Anywhere clone path.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-anywhere": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/Users/yourname/Projects/mcp-anywhere", "mcp-anywhere", "connect"]
    }
  }
}
```

Lastly, set up the MCP Anywhere application before starting Claude Desktop:

```bash
uv run mcp-anywhere serve stdio
```

**HTTP API Integration:**
```python
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import BearerAuth

async with Client(
    "https://your-app.fly.dev/mcp/",
    auth=BearerAuth(token="<oauth-token>")
) as client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
```

**Command Line Interface:**
```bash
# For MCP client connection
mcp-anywhere connect
# Or: python -m mcp_anywhere connect

# For STDIO server mode (local Claude Desktop integration)
mcp-anywhere serve stdio

# For HTTP server mode with OAuth (production)
mcp-anywhere serve http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Features

### Tool Discovery and Management
- Automatic repository analysis using Claude AI
- Container health monitoring with intelligent remounting
